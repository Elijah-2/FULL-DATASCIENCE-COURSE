    "# WHAT IS THE SUMARY FOR PYTHON FOR BEGINERS ?\n",
    "### Python is a popular, versatile programming language that is known for its simplicity and readability, making it ideal for beginners.:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Syntax and Structure\n",
    "### Indentation: Python uses indentation (spaces or tabs) to define blocks of code, such as loops and functions, instead of curly braces or other delimiters.\n",
    "### Comments: Use # to write comments. Comments are ignored by the interpreter and are used to describe code.\n",
    "## 2. Variables and Data Types\n",
    "### Python supports several built-in data types, such as:\n",
    "### int (integers): x = 5\n",
    "### float (decimal numbers): y = 3.14\n",
    "### str (strings): name = \"Alice\"\n",
    "### bool (boolean values): is_active = True\n",
    "### Variables are dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare a type when you create a variable.\n",
    "## 3. Control Flow\n",
    "### Conditionals: if, elif, and else are used for conditional execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### if x > 0:\n",
    "   ###  print(\"Positive\")\n",
    "### elif x < 0:\n",
    "   ###  print(\"Negative\")\n",
    "### else:\n",
    "   ###  print(\"Zero\")\n",
    "## Loops: Python has for and while loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "### for i in range(5):  # loop from 0 to 4\n",
    "    ### print(i)\n",
    "## 4. Functions\n",
    "## Functions are defined using the def keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "## def greet(name):\n",
    "###     return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n",
    "### print(greet(\"Alice\"))\n",
    "## 5. Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries\n",
    "### Lists are ordered and mutable collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "### my_list.append(4)\n",
    "### Tuples are similar to lists but immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "## Dictionaries store data in key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### my_dict = {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 25}\n",
    "### 6. Error Handling\n",
    "###  Python uses try and except blocks to handle exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### try:\n",
    "###     result = 10 / 0\n",
    "### except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "###     print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
    "### 7. Libraries and Modules\n",
    "### Python has a vast standard library and external libraries (like numpy for numerical operations and matplotlib for plotting). You can import them using import.\n",
    "\n",
    "### import math\n",
    "### print(math.sqrt(16))\n",
    "### 8. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    "### Python supports classes and objects. A class defines the blueprint, and an object is an instance of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### class Dog:\n",
    "###     def __init__(self, name, breed):\n",
    "###         self.name = name\n",
